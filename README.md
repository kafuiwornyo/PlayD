# PlayD — Crowd-Powered DJ Requests

PlayD is a two-sided web application that lets partygoers request songs for a DJ through a clean search interface, with optional paid priority boosting. DJs get a real-time dashboard to triage and act on requests without leaving the booth.

## The Problem

At live events, song requests are chaotic — people yell across the room, text the DJ, or interrupt the booth. Requests rarely include the information DJs actually need: an exact track match, BPM/key for mixing, and social context. DJs have no structured way to triage requests by priority while maintaining fairness and control of the set.

## The Solution

PlayD turns requests into a ranked, metadata-rich queue with optional paid prioritization. Guests get a clean search interface backed by the iTunes catalog. DJs get a real-time dashboard to filter, sort, and act on requests — all updated live via Supabase Realtime with no refresh needed.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- A Supabase project with the schema applied (see [Database Schema](#database-schema))
- A GetSongBPM API key (for BPM/key lookups)

### 1. Clone and install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PlayD-Dev/PlayD.git
cd PlayD/frontend
npm install
```

### 2. Configure environment variables

Create `frontend/.env.local`:

```env
# Supabase
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://<your-project>.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<anon key from Project Settings → API>
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=<service_role key from Project Settings → API>

# GetSongBPM (BPM/key metadata)
GETSONGBPM_API_KEY=<your key from getsongbpm.com>

# App URL (used for QR code generation)
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

### 3. Enable Supabase Realtime

In the Supabase dashboard: **Database → Replication** → enable the `requests` table. This allows the DJ dashboard to receive live updates.

### 4. Seed test data

Insert a DJ profile and a test event so you have something to work with:

```sql
INSERT INTO dj_profiles (id, email, dj_name)
VALUES ('d1000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001', 'dj@playd.test', 'DJ PlayD');

INSERT INTO events (id, dj_id, name, event_code, status)
VALUES (
  'e1000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001',
  'd1000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001',
  'Saturday Night Live Set',
  'FUNK42',
  'live'
);
```

### 5. Run the dev server

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

Open:
- **Guest page**: `http://localhost:3000/request/e1000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001`
- **DJ dashboard**: `http://localhost:3000/dashboard`

## How It Works

### Guest Flow

1. Guest opens `/request/[eventId]`
2. The page fetches the event name from Supabase and renders the search UI
3. On mount, `POST /api/sessions` creates an anonymous guest session tied to the event
4. Guest types a song name — debounced search hits `GET /api/search` (iTunes proxy)
5. Guest taps a result — `GET /api/track-meta` fetches BPM, key, and time signature
6. Guest selects a boost amount (Free / $2 / $5 / $10), adds an optional message, and submits
7. `POST /api/requests` upserts the track and inserts the request row in Supabase
8. Supabase Realtime broadcasts the INSERT to the DJ dashboard in real-time

### DJ Dashboard Flow

1. DJ opens `/dashboard`
2. Dashboard fetches all `pending` requests for the event (joined with track and session data)
3. A Supabase Realtime channel subscribes to `INSERT` and `UPDATE` events on `requests`
4. New requests appear at the top of the queue with a FLIP animation
5. DJ filters by All / Paid / Free and sorts by Priority / Time / BPM
6. DJ clicks an action (Seen / Save / Play / Skip) → optimistic UI removes the card, `PATCH /api/requests/[id]` updates the status in Supabase

## API Reference

### `POST /api/sessions`

Creates an anonymous guest session for an event.

**Body:**
```json
{ "eventId": "uuid", "displayName": "Guest Name" }
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "sessionId": "uuid",
  "eventId": "uuid",
  "eventName": "Saturday Night Live Set",
  "djName": "DJ PlayD"
}
```

**Errors:** `404` if event not found or ended.

---

### `POST /api/requests`

Submits a song request. Upserts the track first, then inserts the request.

**Body:**
```json
{
  "eventId": "uuid",
  "sessionId": "uuid",
  "track": { "trackId": 1234, "trackName": "Blinding Lights", "artistName": "The Weeknd", ... },
  "message": "Please play this one next!",
  "boostAmount": 5
}
```

**Response:** `201` with the created request row (joined with track data).

**Notes:**
- `boostAmount` maps directly to `priority_score` in the database (0 = free)
- Tracks are deduplicated by iTunes `trackId` (stored in the `spotify_id` column)

---

### `PATCH /api/requests/[id]`

Updates the status of a request. Called by the DJ dashboard.

**Body:**
```json
{ "status": "seen" | "saved" | "played" | "skipped" | "cancelled" }
```

**Response:**
```json
{ "request": { "id": "uuid", "status": "played" } }
```

**Notes:** Terminal statuses (`played`, `skipped`, `cancelled`) also set `resolved_at`.

---

### `GET /api/search?q=blinding+lights&limit=10`

Proxies the iTunes Search API. Max `limit` is 25.

**Response:**
```json
{ "tracks": [ { "trackId": 1234, "trackName": "...", "artistName": "...", ... } ] }
```

---

### `GET /api/track-meta?title=Blinding+Lights&artist=The+Weeknd`

Returns BPM, musical key, Camelot notation, and time signature from GetSongBPM.

**Response:**
```json
{ "bpm": 171, "key": "A Minor", "camelot": "8A", "timeSignature": "4/4" }
```

---

### `GET /api/qrcode?url=https://playd.app/request/...`

Returns a QR code PNG for the given URL. Used by the DJ dashboard to display a scannable join link.

## Real-Time Architecture

The DJ dashboard subscribes to Supabase Realtime using `postgres_changes` on the `requests` table, filtered by `event_id`. This is powered by PostgreSQL logical replication (via the `supabase_realtime` publication) and Phoenix Channels — capable of handling millions of concurrent WebSocket connections.

```
Guest submits request
  → POST /api/requests (service role insert)
  → PostgreSQL writes row
  → supabase_realtime publication broadcasts change
  → DJ dashboard receives INSERT event via WebSocket
  → Follow-up SELECT joins track + session data
  → Card appears in queue with animation
```

**Scalability:** At 1,000+ concurrent guests, each guest generates at most one INSERT per request. The dashboard holds a single WebSocket connection per DJ. Supabase's free tier supports 200 concurrent Realtime connections; paid tiers scale to tens of thousands.

## What's Not Yet Wired

| Feature | Status |
|---------|--------|
| DJ authentication (login/signup) | UI built, Supabase Auth not integrated |
| Stripe payment processing | Schema ready, no handlers |
| Guest real-time status updates | Backend only; no guest-facing "your request was played" UI |
| Event creation by DJ | No UI yet |
| NestJS backend | Exists but frontend doesn't use it |
